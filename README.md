# Shopping-Mall-Sales-Analysis-MySQL

‚û§ Project Overview  
This MySQL project analyzes shopping mall sales data to uncover top-performing malls, category trends, payment method preferences, demographic insights, and time-based sales patterns using advanced SQL queries.  

The goal is to transform raw retail data into meaningful business insights that help understand overall performance and customer behavior across different shopping malls.
